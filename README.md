# Block Class

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to leverage Github Actions to build a Drupal 10 site, install the above module, and conduct the following:

* Static Analysis:  Use phpstan-drupal extension for phpstan to conduct a static scan of the module codebase for deprecations for both PHP 8 and Drupal 10.
* Coding Standards:  Check for compliance with Drupal Coding Standards.
* Unit Tests:  Execute any unit tests included in the module's codebase to make sure that unit testing integrity is intact after patching for deprecations and coding standards compliance.
